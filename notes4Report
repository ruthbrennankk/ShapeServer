THING 1
For getting the images have to host them on a local server due to "cannot access local resource" -- (Cannot open local file - Chrome: Not allowed to load local resource)

Solution:

    1) Open your terminal and type

    npm install -g http-server

    2) Go to the root folder that you want to serve you files and type:

    http-server ./

    3) Read the output of the terminal, something kinda http://localhost:8080 will appear.

    Everything on there will be allowed to be got. Example:
    background: url('http://localhost:8080/waw.png');
